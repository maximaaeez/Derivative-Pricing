The code implements a pricing engine for financial derivatives (like options) using:

Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to simulate asset price paths.

Risk-neutral pricing via Monte Carlo simulations.

The Black-Scholes formula for closed-form option pricing.



The code provides:

Simulated paths of asset prices.

Prices of call and put options using different methods.

Error analysis between the two pricing methods.
