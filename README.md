# Derivative-Pricing
The code implements a pricing engine for financial derivatives (like options) using:

1. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to simulate asset price paths.

2. Risk-neutral pricing via Monte Carlo simulations.

3. The Black-Scholes formula for closed-form option pricing.



The code provides:

1. Simulated paths of asset prices.

2. Prices of call and put options using different methods.

3. Error analysis between the two pricing methods.
